Codebase Genius 💡

Note: This project is an implementation of the "Codebase Genius" assignment using Python, Streamlit, and the Google Gemini API.

This is an AI-powered, multi-agent system that automatically generates high-quality documentation for any public GitHub repository.

🚀 How it Works

The application follows a multi-agent architecture, as specified in the assignment:

Supervisor (app.py): A Streamlit UI that orchestrates the workflow.

Repo Mapper (repo_mapper.py): Clones the target repository, maps its file structure, and reads the README.md.

DocGenie (LLM Agent - doc_genie.py): A dedicated agent that uses the Google Gemini API to perform AI-based tasks, such as summarizing the README and generating the final documentation.

Code Analyzer (code_analyzer.py): Parses the Python code using tree-sitter to build a Code Context Graph (CCG) of files, functions, and classes.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit

Backend & Orchestration: Python

LLM: Google Gemini (google-generativeai)

Git Operations: GitPython

Code Parsing: tree-sitter & tree-sitter-languages

Graphing: networkx (for the CCG)

⚙️ Setup and Installation

1. Clone the Repository

git clone [Your-GitHub-Repo-URL]
cd codebase_genius


2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

On Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate


On macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies

All required libraries are pinned to working versions in requirements.txt.

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Set Up Your API Key (CRITICAL)

This project requires a Google Gemini API key.

Create a new folder in your project directory named .streamlit:

mkdir .streamlit


Inside that folder, create a file named secrets.toml:

# On Windows (in PowerShell)
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"' > .streamlit\secrets.toml

# On macOS/Linux
echo 'GOOGLE_API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"' > .streamlit/secrets.toml


Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual Google AI API key.

▶️ How to Run

With your virtual environment active and your API key in place, simply run:

streamlit run app.py


A browser window will open automatically. You can then paste a public GitHub URL (e.g., https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit-example) to generate the documentation.
